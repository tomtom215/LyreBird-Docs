# Project Origin

The story behind LyreBirdAudio.

---

## Background

LyreBirdAudio was originally developed for monitoring backyard bird activity. The goal was to create a reliable, set-it-and-forget-it system that could run 24/7 without manual intervention.

---

## Evolution

What started as a simple bird monitoring solution evolved into a production-grade RTSP streaming suite. Through extensive testing and real-world deployment, the system gained:

- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Robust USB device handling
- Comprehensive diagnostics
- Professional management tools

---

## Production Proven

The system has been battle-tested in continuous operation:

- 24/7 uptime
- USB hotplug event handling
- Automatic recovery from failures
- System reboot persistence
- Weather-related power event recovery

---

## Open Source

LyreBirdAudio is open source under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing anyone to use, modify, and deploy the system for their own use cases.
